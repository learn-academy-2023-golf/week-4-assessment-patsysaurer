# ASSESSMENT 4: Behavioral Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. Use the Nugget + STAR method for each answer.

1. Why did you choose a career in software development?

- Nugget: 
When I was in high school I had the opportunity to take a programming class. I knew nothing about it but I signed up anyway. Even though it was extremely challenging for me I wanted to learn more. I wasn't able to afford the tech program I wanted to go to after high school so I chose to work and then I joined the military.

- Situation: 
After the military I was really into baking and wanted to start my own cake business. I earned a degree in baking and pastry and started a home cake business. It was fun at first, then it was so hard to keep up with for one person along with the details I would promise. I ended up working as a full time pastry chef instead and that became even more stressful. I knew I loved the tedious tasks and recipe development so I put that into a different perspective and decided to go to school for web design and development. 

- Task: 
First I knew I needed to get up to date with the tech field coming from the food industry. I also knew I had to find the material or program to teach me web design and development. And I also had to make sure my husband was onboard with me transitioning to a new field. 

- Action:
I went on Twitter to see what all the buzz was about and one of the first things I saw was Tech Brew, which was really all I needed. I subscribed to their newsletter and have been reading the tech news since. I also used the rest of my education benefits to earn a bachelor's degree in Web Design and learned how to design and code a website. My husband was very supportive and held down the household while I increased my knowledge. 

- Result: 
Upon completion of the web design program I felt like I was limited with what I knew how to build. I didn't really know how to program so I decided to continue to learn more about programming specifically. I signed up for a previous coding bootcamp and the entry process took me out. The challenges were too difficult and I was quickly rejected. I took a few Udemy courses on JavaScript and signed up for another coding bootcamp and was accepting at LEARN Academy. Perhaps the urge of me wanting to program so bad comes from the void of developing a recipe and baking from scratch.


2. In previous roles, how have you helped teammates succeed?

- Nugget:
 When I was in the Navy out to sea we had the opportunity to earn a few military badges. One of which was focused on the aviation scope of the ship, known as the Enslisted Aviation Warfare Specialist(EAWS). A ship mate and I decided to earn our badge together. 

- Situation: 
We both passed the written test, however there was still the "murder board". This is when you stand in front of chiefs to answer any question they ask about the specs of the ship. I ended up passing but my shipmate did not and was quickly discouraged.  

- Task: 
I knew I had to keep studying with him. I planned on quizzing him just like they did in the murder board. I also wanted to make sure it was still going to be fun and not super boring.

- Action: 
We would stay up late every night with so many notes and flash cards quizzing eachother. We did joke around a bit to keep the mood light and we also drank a lot of red bull for the energy and the excuse to walk around and stretch our legs.

- Result: 
He did redo the murder board soon after and he succeeded in earning his badge. He came out very confident and proud. It was a good feeling to help someone succeed and we are still really good friends.
