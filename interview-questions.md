# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: it is similar to regular DOM, however it only updates when necessary according to the state variables inside the components using the React hooks useState. 

Researched answer: a copy of the DOM object, when it gets manipulated it is much faster since it doesn't have to change everything only the objects that have been detected as changed. 

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: it is impling that the method is going to be returned with an outcome so it doesn't need the return keyword.

Researched answer: Every block in Ruby will return the last line automatically, so a return keyword is unnecessary. 

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer: Some similarites for JavaScript and Ruby are that they are both scripting languages, they both organize data in objects and they both use functions and methods to manipulate data. Some differences are that they have their own keywords, different syntax formatting Ruby is simpler and Ruby has it's own terminal to work in. JavaScript has the console on the web.

Researched answer: JavaScript and Ruby are both object-oriented scripting languages, they are both dynamic languages and can manipulate data and they both can be used for back-end devleopment with the help of Node.js for JavaScript, the logic is also the same. Three differences are the syntax, Ruby's is very short, clean and easy to read. JavaScript has a lot of curly braces and difficult to understand for a newbie. The runtime is also different, Ruby seems to be about 4x slower than JavaScript. The frameworks are also built different. Ruby has Ruby on Rails and JavaScript has Node.js.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: a software program to manage and track the changes we make to our code. Such as Github. We can share projects and not have to worry about duplicates or causing errors. 

Researched answer: serves as a safety net to track and manage changes made to the code and files. This is essential to prevent code mixups and errors. It keeps everything organized and available for other developers to access. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Ruby blocks: an anonymous function that is passed to a method to determine the outcome.

2. RSpec: a unit test framework used to describe the behaivor of objects in Ruby. Developers can create specs that provide the desired outcome.

3. Test-driven development: the goal is to check the input and output of the code, similar to behaivor driven but that test focuses on the user
